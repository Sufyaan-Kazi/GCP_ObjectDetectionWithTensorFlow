# GCP_ObjectDetectionWithTensorFlow
This is an automated version of a public GCP Training course for TensorFlow: https://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-object-detection-application-tensorflow. This uses the http://mscoco.org/ data set. It launches a custom EC2 instance running Tensorflow and a web app. The web app allows you to upload an image and will demonstrate tensrflow using different data sets to detect objects in the image.

Change the object detection library by modifying the matching line in startup-script.sh using the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-object-detection-application-tensorflow#change_the_inference_model
